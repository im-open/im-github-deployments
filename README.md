# im-github-deployments

Welcome to the im-github-deployments plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

You can access the plugin by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/im-github-deployments](http://localhost:3000/im-github-deployments).
You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
